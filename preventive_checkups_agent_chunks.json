Characterized by its distinctive histological features of myxoid stroma and spindle-shaped cells, this neoplasm poses significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to its rarity and the non-specific nature of its clinical presentation. Current knowledge regarding the pathogenesis, optimal therapeutic strategies and prognostic factors for pulmonary myxoid sarcoma remains limited, primarily due to the scarcity of reported cases and comprehensive studies. The present study reports a case of pulmonary myxoid sarcoma. A 41-year-old male was admitted to the Jeonbuk National University Hospital due to a pulmonary mass in the left lower lobe discovered during a routine health check-up. A CT scan performed at our hospital revealed a nodule ~1 cm in size in the mediobasal segment of the left lower lobe, with relatively well-defined margins and significant enhancement.",

Twenty-three dietary habits were assessed through face-to-face interviews with 57,737 participants in health check-up programs from 2015 to 2021. The total score of various dietary habits was calculated as the sum of each dietary habit multiplied by its own full-adjusted coefficient (β) for all-cause mortality in Cox proportional hazard models. Cox proportional hazard models were fitted for the associations of total and cause-specific mortality with the scores of various dietary habits. 1,692 deaths occurred after the earliest check-ups in our center, followed up for a median time of 2.14 years (range: 1.01-7.71 years).

The aim of this descriptive epidemiological study is to investigate the characteristics of injuries among Japanese international athletes during pre-competition medical check-ups from 2008 to 2019. Methods We analyzed the medical check-up data of candidates for international multi-sport events according to the International Olympic Committee consensus statement. At the medical check-up, athletes' injuries were categorized into two groups based on clinical assessment. \"Injuries\" refer to conditions that necessitate immediate treatment or further detailed examination. On the other hand, \"complaints\" encompass both such \"injuries\" and conditions for which treatment has already commenced, allowing athletes to continue participating in competitions or training while still requiring ongoing medical monitoring. The cohort was categorized into youth and adult groups, with adults defined as those aged ≥18 years.",

This study aimed to examine the levels of physical check-ups (self-reported check-ups within the last year) by age group (those aged 18–59 years and those aged = ≥ 60 years) and the role of health literacy regarding physical check-ups in the United States. Methods Data for the study were obtained from the 2017 Health Information National Trends Survey. The original sample included 3,285 respondents, but only 3,146 surveys were used for this study. Andersen’s Behavioral Model of Health Services Use guided this study, and a binomial logistic regression model was conducted using Stata 12.0 software package. Results While 82.0 % of the older group had an annual check-up, 67.3 % of the younger group had one. Both groups had similar ratios for health literacy-related item reporting.",

In comparison, it was positively associated with difficulty understanding information for the older group. Conclusions To increase annual physical check-ups, health literacy-related interventions should be developed and address the barriers most associated with health check-ups. One way of addressing this barrier is to improve communication from healthcare professionals to consumers through the use of easy-to-understand explanations appropriate for the consumer.",

We conducted an extensive, comprehensive, and systematic literature search across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, Cochrane, Scopus, and ISI Web of Knowledge, without any restrictions on publication date or language. In addition, we reviewed grey literature and reports. The data were meticulously analysed with a focus on screening of TB active disease and infection effectiveness indicators, and cost-effectiveness economic analyses as a primary objective and the comprehension of barriers and facilitators of screening as a secondary objective. Our review included 43 studies covering over 8 million migrants from 11 countries. The findings demonstrate that while screening uptake was high, coverage varied, and completion rates for preventive treatments were low.",

Traditional white-light imaging has limitations in detecting lesions, particularly those with flat morphology or minimal color contrast with the surrounding mucosa. It also struggles to distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions. These limitations led to the development of image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE). Image-enhanced endoscopy modalities such as narrow-band imaging, blue laser imaging, linked color imaging, and texture and color enhancement imaging enhance mucosal surface and vascular pattern visualization, thereby improving lesion detection and characterization. In contrast, red dichromatic imaging is primarily designed to enhance the visibility of deep blood vessels, making it particularly useful during therapeutic endoscopies, such as identifying bleeding sources and monitoring post-treatment hemostasis. Although IEE enhances lesion detection and characterization, it remains limited in assessing submucosal invasion depth, which is a key factor in treatment decisions.",

This study aimed to develop a method for early detection of intractable PPH, characterized by arterial contrast extravasation on dynamic CT (PRACE), often requiring uterine arterial embolization. The study comprised two components: (1) an ex vivo study, evaluating the PRACE visualization model using a postpartum uterine cavity simulation, and (2) an in vivo study assessing whether the time interval for bleeding to appear at the vagina (TI-V) could serve as an indicator of intractable PPH. The ex vivo simulation of PPH at various flow rates suggested that the overflow time from the uterine cavity may assist in stratifying life-threatening PPH. In the in vivo study, TI-V was measured in cases of uncomplicated vaginal delivery and severe PPH, including those transported for treatment.",

Factors such as misconceptions about the disease, a preference for unproven traditional herbal treatments, and the high cost of treatment hinder effective secondary responses.

Our goal was to develop a simpler global definition of statin-eligible primary prevention patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) cited in North American and European dyslipidemia guidelines justifying primary prevention statins for cardiovascular risk reduction were critically reappraised according to eligibility criteria and characteristics of actual enrollees. Statin-eligibility based on meeting minimal enrolment criteria versus risks calculated using either the Framingham Risk Score, the Pooled Cohort Equation and the Systematic Coronary Risk Estimate 2 were contrasted.<h4>Results</h4>Patient scenarios meeting minimal RCT eligibility criteria seldom attained high enough 10 year risk of events according to the algorithms tested and thus would not be eligible for statin therapy.

Methods In a multicenter trial in Spain, we assigned 7447 participants (55 to 80 years of age, 57% women) who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra‐virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce dietary fat). Participants received quarterly educational sessions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of extra‐virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was a major cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). After a median follow‐up of 4.8 years, the trial was stopped on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis.",

More recently, advances in the development of Lecanemab, an anti-amyloid-β monoclonal antibody, have shown positive results in reducing brain A burden and slowing cognitive decline in patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease in the Phase III clinical trial (Clarity Alzheimer's disease). Despite these promising results, side effects such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may limit its usage. ARIA can manifest as ARIA-E (cerebral edema or effusions) and ARIA-H (microhemorrhages or superficial siderosis) and is thought to be caused by increased vascular permeability due to inflammatory responses, leading to leakages of blood products and protein-rich fluid into brain parenchyma.

Factors such as misconceptions about the disease, a preference for unproven traditional herbal treatments, and the high cost of treatment hinder effective secondary responses.

Recent data show that CDB has become the most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in Japan, driven by an aging population and the increased use of antithrombotic medications. Although 70%-90% of patients achieve spontaneous hemostasis, rebleeding occurs in up to 35% of cases within 1 year. Despite an overall mortality rate of < 1%, patients with CDB can present with hypovolemic shock and may require urgent intervention.

Over the last 30 years, the benefit of screening with a PSA test has been a matter of significant debate because of its association with overscreening, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment of prostate cancer. Although most prostate cancer screening guidelines recommend a shared decision-making approach between the patient and provider, these recommendations are contradictory in terms of screening initiation, frequency, and discontinuation as well as screening recommendations for high-risk populations. This article describes a literature review comparing screening guidelines with newer research in order to determine which guideline aligns most closely with the latest findings. Results show that the related American Urological Association and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, for example, may lead to over- or underscreening, whereas the American Cancer Society (ACS) guideline seems most closely in alignment with recent research.",

The present two-wave longitudinal study examines the interplay between study motivation, test anxiety, academic procrastination, and sleep among 121 university students (78.5% female; Mage = 21.69, SD = 1.39). To estimate changes when approaching exams, participants completed surveys in the month preceding and during exams. Latent change models showed mean-level increases in controlled motivation, test anxiety, and poor sleep quality, while procrastination decreased. Structural models revealed strong concurrent and longitudinal links between controlled motivation and both test anxiety and procrastination. Procrastination was mainly associated with decreased sleep hygiene, while test anxiety was robustly linked to decreased sleep quality. Indirect effects from controlled motivation to poor sleep quality through test anxiety were significant. Autonomous motivation acted as a buffer against sleep problems. Findings underscore the importance of interventions targeting motivation quality, especially by minimising controlled motivation, to mitigate sleep problems during exams.",

Exosomes are small and can effectively cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing them to target deep brain lesions. Recent studies have demonstrated that exosomes derived from different cell types may exert therapeutic effects by regulating the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, mRNAs, and disease-related proteins, thereby halting the progression of neurodegenerative diseases and exhibiting beneficial effects. However, exosomes are composed of lipid bilayer membranes and lack the ability to recognize specific target cells. This limitation can lead to side effects and toxicity when they interact with non-specific cells.

To diagnose LS, the microsatellite instability (MSI) test or immunohistochemistry of MMR enzymes is used as a conventional clinical screening method for all patients with colorectal and endometrial cancers. Recently, patients with advanced-stage cancers have undergone comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP), which is useful not only for the detection of molecularly targeted personalized therapies, but also for the screening of hereditary cancer syndromes by determining presumed germline pathogenic variants (PGPVs). Between January 2020 and April 2024, 1583 patients underwent CGP at our institute. PGPVs in MMR genes were detected in 19 patients. Although one patient died prior to the disclosure of the results and eight patients declined confirmatory genetic testing, the remaining ten patients underwent confirmatory genetic tests, of whom six were found to have a hereditary origin.",

Although PCA is most commonly a form of Alzheimer disease (AD), its early diagnosis is usually delayed due to a lack of understanding for how best to clinically screen for the syndrome. Objective: To identify neurobehavioral screening tasks for PCA—beyond simple visual constructions—that can be administered in clinic or at bedside. Method: We compared the performance of 12 individuals who met neuroimaging-supported consensus criteria for PCA with that of 12 matched individuals with typical AD (tAD) and 24 healthy controls (HC) on clinic/bedside tasks measuring (a) complex figure copying, (b) Balint syndrome, (c) visual object agnosia, (d) color identification, (e) figure–ground discrimination, (f) global–local processing, (g) dressing apraxia, (h) ideomotor apraxia, and (i) Gerstmann syndrome.",

As the primary immune cells of the central nervous system, microglia play dual roles in neuroinflammation and tissue repair following a stroke. Their dynamic activation and polarization states are key factors that influence the disease process and treatment outcomes. This review article investigates the role of microglia in ischemic stroke and explores potential intervention strategies. Microglia exhibit a dynamic functional state, transitioning between pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotypes. This duality is crucial in ischemic stroke, as it maintains a balance between neuroinflammation and tissue repair. Activated microglia contribute to neuroinflammation through cytokine release and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, while simultaneously promoting tissue repair through anti-inflammatory responses and regeneration.",

A majority moderately/strongly agreed that maternal immunization and mAbs provide protection to the baby (77.0% and 87.0%, respectively). In DCE, physicians chose RSV immunization 96.1% of the time vs no immunization (3.9%). The most important attributes that drove physicians' preferences were: increasing durability of protection from 90 to 180 days (24.9%), increasing efficacy against RSV hospitalization from 57% to 80% (20.9%), and increasing efficacy against medically-attended RSV from 51% to 80% (20.2%). Understanding physicians' attitudes and preferences regarding RSV immunization strategies is important as new RSV prevention methods become available and are introduced into clinical practice.",

This research presents the inaugural assessment of the virus shedding rate and the genetic diversity of OPV shedding strains across different Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV)-OPV sequential immunization schedules. Our findings revealed that the shedding rate of different serotypes in each sequential immunization groups peaked within 7 days following the initial administration of OPV, and then gradually decreased. Prior vaccination with OPV reduced the rate and shortened the duration of virus shedding. Additionally, we observed a slight increase in the shedding rate of type3 after the removal of type2 from trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The comprehensive analysis of the whole-genome high-throughput sequencing results for the shedding strain revealed that the variation sites among samples from different sequential immunization groups were distributed throughout the entire genome.",

Factors such as misconceptions about the disease, a preference for unproven traditional herbal treatments, and the high cost of treatment hinder effective secondary responses.

Deep models for mammogram analysis and mass (or micro-calcification) detection require training with a large volume of labeled images, which are often expensive and time-consuming to collect. To reduce this challenge, we proposed a method that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) and a deep hybrid model, named HybMNet, which combines local self-attention and fine-grained feature extraction to enhance breast cancer detection on screening mammograms. Our method employs a two-stage learning process: (1) SSL pretraining: We utilize Efficient Self-Supervised Vision Transformers, an SSL technique, to pretrain a Swin Transformer (Swin-T) using a limited set of mammograms.

However, it is difficult to determine whether a breast lump is benign or cancerous at early stages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to solve this problem and have provided useful advancements. However, CNNs focus only on a certain portion of the mammogram while ignoring the remaining and present computational complexity because of multiple convolutions. Recently, vision transformers have been developed as a technique to overcome such limitations of CNNs, ensuring better or comparable performance in natural image classification. However, the utility of this technique has not been thoroughly investigated in the medical image domain.

In Georgia, it ranks as the fifth most frequent cancer among women overall and the third among women aged 15-44 years. Approximately 1.60 million women aged 15 years and older in Georgia are at risk of developing cervical cancer. Annually, about 327 women are diagnosed, and 204 die from the disease. Screening for cervical cancer is crucial for reducing incidence and mortality rates. While the conventional Pap smear has been the primary screening method, its limitations in sensitivity and sample adequacy have led to the development of liquid-based cytology (LBC).<h4>Materials and methods</h4>This study analyzed 1000 cervical cytology samples from women aged 18-65 years in Georgia, who were gynecologically asymptomatic and not vaccinated for HPV. The median age was 37 years. Informed consent was obtained for all participants.",

  "chunk_text": "The history of prostate cancer screening has evolved from relying on the Digital Rectal Exam to the introduction of PSA test. Initially, DRE was the cornerstone for diagnosing aggressive PCa, but the advent of PSA testing allowed for proactive detection. Distinctions between screening for the general population and early detection for individuals are vital. The French Onco-Urology Recommendations cite the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC), highlighting a 21% reduction in mortality using total PSA for screening, endorsing DRE in combination with PSA for early detection. However, a comprehensive analysis of the ERSPC study raises questions about DRE's role in screening. Studies indicate weak correlations between DRE and PCa diagnosis, especially with low PSA values. DRE's reproducibility is also a concern. As the ERSPC study progressed, DRE's significance diminished, and PSA became the primary screening tool. Other trials omitted DRE from their protocols, emphasizing PSA’s dominance.",

Hence, several studies have focused on developing hybrid learning, end-to-end, and transfer learning techniques to reduce manual interaction and for labelling the regions of interest. However, these weak learning techniques do not always provide a clear diagnosis. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a clear explainable learning method that can highlight factors and form the basis of clinical decisions. However, there has been little research carried out employing such transparent approaches. This study discussed the aforementioned models for colon cancer diagnosis.

Colonoscopy is performed routinely for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, follow-up of other abnormal screening tests, workup of signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal disease, and surveillance after CRC and polyp removal. Post procedure, colonoscopists are expected to provide follow-up recommendations to patients and referring physicians. Recommendations for follow-up after normal colonoscopy among individuals age-eligible for screening, and post-polypectomy among all individuals with polyps are among the most common clinical scenarios requiring guidance. 1",

  "chunk_text": "Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition that affects bones and cartilage, often leading to structural changes, including osteophyte formation, bone density loss, and the narrowing of joint spaces. Over time, this process may disrupt the glenohumeral (GH) joint functionality, requiring a targeted treatment. Various options are available to restore joint functions, ranging from conservative management to surgical interventions, depending on the severity of the condition. This work introduces an innovative deep learning framework to process shoulder CT scans. It features the semantic segmentation of the proximal humerus and scapula, the 3D reconstruction of bone surfaces, the identification of the GH joint region, and the staging of three common osteoarthritic-related conditions: osteophyte formation (OS), GH space reduction (JS), and humeroscapular alignment (HSA). Each condition was stratified into multiple severity stages, offering a comprehensive analysis of shoulder bone structure pathology.",

Root mean squared error and Hausdorff distance median values for 3D reconstruction were 0.22 mm and 1.48 mm for the humerus and 0.24 mm and 1.48 mm for the scapula, outperforming state-of-the-art architectures and making it potentially suitable for a PSI-based shoulder arthroplasty preoperative plan context. The classification accuracy for OS, JS, and HSA consistently reached around 90% across all three categories.

Despite great advances in lung cancer care (e.g., screening and nodule programs to identify early-stage disease and immune-mediated and targeted therapies for advanced-stage disease), disparities persist both in the United States and globally. In this narrative review, the spectrum of disparities that influence lung cancer care on a national scale, including race, ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and insurance access are explored. The review focuses on how disparities impact screening efforts and lung cancer treatments. Where data are available, trends on a global scale are addressed.

This study introduces a model designed to distinguish between wellness and other types of veterinary visits. Objectives The purpose of this study is to validate the use of a visit classification model compared to manual classification of veterinary visits by three board-certified veterinarians. Materials and methods The algorithm was initially trained using a Gradient Boosting Machine model with a dataset of 11,105 clinical visits from 2012 to 2017 involving 655 animals (85.3% dogs and 14.7% cats) across 544 U.S. veterinary practices.",

Results The model demonstrated a specificity of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91 to 0.96), implying its accuracy in distinguishing non-wellness visits. The model had a sensitivity of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80 to 0.92), indicating its ability to correctly identify wellness visits as compared to the annotations provided by veterinary experts. The balanced accuracy, calculated as 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87 to 0.93), further confirms the model’s overall effectiveness. Clinical significance The model exhibits high specificity and sensitivity, ensuring accurate identification of a high proportion of wellness visits.",

  "chunk_text": "Since 2020, multiple large-scale studies (CODE BLUE-J) in Japan have accelerated the accumulation of evidence on colonic diverticular bleeding (CDB). This review summarizes the latest findings regarding CDB epidemiology and endoscopic hemostasis. Recent data show that CDB has become the most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in Japan, driven by an aging population and the increased use of antithrombotic medications. Although 70%-90% of patients achieve spontaneous hemostasis, rebleeding occurs in up to 35% of cases within 1 year. Despite an overall mortality rate of < 1%, patients with CDB can present with hypovolemic shock and may require urgent intervention. There are no effective pharmacological treatments for controlling CDB. Therefore, endoscopic therapy plays a crucial role in its management. Based on available evidence, both clipping and endoscopic band ligation are considered effective initial treatments.",

  "chunk_text": "Recent studies indicate that direct clipping reduces early rebleeding compared with indirect clipping, while endoscopic band ligation achieves lower rebleeding rates (13%-15%) than clipping. The choice between direct clipping and endoscopic band ligation depends on the diverticulum location and the presence of active bleeding. Newer techniques, such as over-the-scope clip and self-assembling peptide application, have shown potential, but require further study. The detection of the bleeding source remains challenging because accurate identification is essential for successful hemostasis. Additional research is needed to refine the endoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, prevent rebleeding, and improve patient outcomes.",

A colonoscopy revealed a submucosal tumor-like protrusion in the Rb lesion of the rectum without neoplastic epithelial changes. Forceps biopsies of the overlying mucosa were non-diagnostic; however, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy revealed that the specimen was poorly differentiated non-small cell invasive carcinoma. Then, we performed a chest computed tomography and a newly detected mass lesion in the upper lobe of the right lung.

Previous research has documented that mental health among children and adolescents is associated with immediate and long-term physical health and chronic disease, health risk behaviors, social relationships, education, and employment. Public health surveillance of children’s mental health can be used to monitor trends in prevalence across populations, increase knowledge about demographic and geographic differences, and support decision-making about prevention and intervention. Numerous federal data systems collect data on various indicators of children’s mental health, particularly mental disorders. The 2013–2019 data from these data systems show that mental disorders begin in early childhood and affect children with a range of sociodemographic characteristics.",

We demonstrate that the e3-skin can serve as a sustainable surveillance platform to capture the real-time physiological state of individuals during regular daily activities. We also show that by coupling the information collected from the e3-skin with machine learning, we were able to predict an individual’s degree of behavior impairments (i.e., reaction time and inhibitory control) after alcohol consumption. The e3-skin paves the path for future autonomous manufacturing of customizable wearable systems that will enable widespread utility for regular health monitoring and clinical applications.",

Recent studies have found that financial literacy promotes preventive healthcare usage and reduces risky health behaviors such as smoking, lack of exercise, and gambling. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that financial literacy, as a rational decision-making tool, is positively associated with health check-up behavior in Japan. We extracted data on financial literacy, the main explanatory variable of this study, from the 2010 wave of the Preference Parameter Study (PPS) of Osaka University. Data on health check-up behavior as a dependent variable, along with control variables, were obtained from the 2011 PPS wave. Our sample focused on Japan’s middle-aged working population (40–64 years), and we applied probit regressions to test our hypothesis. Our final sample size was 2,208 participants after merging the two datasets.",

Recent data show that CDB has become the most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in Japan, driven by an aging population and the increased use of antithrombotic medications. Although 70%-90% of patients achieve spontaneous hemostasis, rebleeding occurs in up to 35% of cases within 1 year. Despite an overall mortality rate of < 1%, patients with CDB can present with hypovolemic shock and may require urgent intervention. There are no effective pharmacological treatments for controlling CDB. Therefore, endoscopic therapy plays a crucial role in its management.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the interplay between gut microbiota and host epigenetics plays a multifaceted role in health maintenance and disease prevention. Intestinal microflora, along with their metabolites, could regulate multiple epigenetic pathways; e.g., DNA methylation, miRNA, or histone modification. Moreover, epigenetic factors can serve as mediators to coordinate gut microbiota within the host.

An important question is whether such measurement can sensitively measure subtle disbalances in the progression toward disease, as well as the subtle effects of, for example, nutritional improvement. The concept of resilience biomarkers, defined as the dynamic evaluation of the biological response to an external challenge, has been identified as a viable strategy to measure these subtle effects.

There is a dearth in the literature evaluating educational interventions for counseling skills among preclinical medical students. Closing this gap is crucial to taking advantage of critical opportunities early in training.<h4>Methods</h4>We taught a session on evidence-based counseling for lifestyle changes to 124 preclinical medical students using case scenarios and role-plays. Our evaluation included (1) measures of perceived importance of and confidence in counseling and (2) measures of perceived gains related to learning objectives. We also undertook qualitative analysis of the session evaluation and thematic analysis of written assignments.<h4>Results</h4>There were statistically significant increases in perceived importance of and confidence in lifestyle counseling. Postintervention student responses demonstrated the highest gain for listing and addressing obstacles to physician counseling, followed by applying physician counseling interventions.",

Based on the session evaluation, we are refining assignment instructions for clarity, providing more time for each role-play, and starting with a faculty role-play demonstration. Aggregate data over time will be more robust than our single cohort. Our evaluation was limited to self-reported attitudes and role-play transcript review, but future interventions could use thematic analysis of recorded role-plays or direct observation of patient simulations.",

The prevalence of chronic cough was 10% (95%CI 9.1,11.0%) with 46.4% being \"unexplained\".",

In this review, we highlight pregnancy as a key period in a woman's life, which can improve compliance with different types of diet, physical activity, and behavioural programs, affecting the next generation's health, and breaking the vicious cycle of family obesity.",

Primary care providers should universally assess children for obesity risk to improve early identification of elevated BMI, medical risks, and unhealthy eating and physical activity habits.

DD can have an enormous impact on the intellectual and personal development of affected children, so early detection is key to implementing preventive strategies for teaching language. Research has shown that there may be biological underpinnings to DD that affect phoneme processing, and hence these symptoms may be identifiable before reading ability is acquired, allowing for early intervention. In this paper we propose a new methodology to assess the risk of DD before students learn to read. For this purpose, we propose a mixed neural model that calculates risk levels of dyslexia from tests that can be completed at the age of 5 years. Our method first trains an auto-encoder, and then combines the trained encoder with an optimized ordinal regression neural network devised to ensure consistency of predictions.",

Traditional white-light imaging has limitations in detecting lesions, particularly those with flat morphology or minimal color contrast with the surrounding mucosa. It also struggles to distinguish neoplastic from non-neoplastic lesions. These limitations led to the development of image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE). Image-enhanced endoscopy modalities such as narrow-band imaging, blue laser imaging, linked color imaging, and texture and color enhancement imaging enhance mucosal surface and vascular pattern visualization, thereby improving lesion detection and characterization. In contrast, red dichromatic imaging is primarily designed to enhance the visibility of deep blood vessels, making it particularly useful during therapeutic endoscopies, such as identifying bleeding sources and monitoring post-treatment hemostasis. Although IEE enhances lesion detection and characterization, it remains limited in assessing submucosal invasion depth, which is a key factor in treatment decisions.",

Endoscopic ultrasound and artificial intelligence-assisted diagnostics have emerged as complementary techniques for improving depth assessment and lesion classification. Additionally, IEE plays a critical role in detecting ulcerative colitis-associated neoplasia (UCAN), which often presents with a flat morphology and indistinct borders. High-definition chromoendoscopy and IEE modalities enhance detection; however, inflammation-related changes limit diagnostic accuracy. Artificial intelligence and molecular biomarkers may improve UCAN diagnosis. This review examines the role of IEE in lesion detection and treatment selection, its limitations, and complementary techniques such as endoscopic ultrasound and artificial intelligence.

This review summarizes the latest findings regarding CDB epidemiology and endoscopic hemostasis. Recent data show that CDB has become the most common cause of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in Japan, driven by an aging population and the increased use of antithrombotic medications. Although 70%-90% of patients achieve spontaneous hemostasis, rebleeding occurs in up to 35% of cases within 1 year. Despite an overall mortality rate of < 1%, patients with CDB can present with hypovolemic shock and may require urgent intervention. There are no effective pharmacological treatments for controlling CDB. Therefore, endoscopic therapy plays a crucial role in its management. Based on available evidence, both clipping and endoscopic band ligation are considered effective initial treatments.",

Early detection significantly improves outcomes, yet current screening methods, such as low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), are limited by high false-positive rates, radiation exposure, and restricted eligibility criteria. This review highlights the transformative potential of genomic and molecular technologies in advancing the early detection of LC. Key innovations include liquid biopsy tools, such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis, which offer minimally invasive approaches to detect tumor-specific genetic and epigenetic alterations. Emerging biomarkers, including methylation signatures, cfDNA fragmentomics, and multi-omics profiles, demonstrate improved sensitivity and specificity in identifying early-stage tumors.

The World Health Organization has declared it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Methods A scoping review was conducted following the methodological framework suggested by Arksey and O’Malley. In this scoping review, 65 research articles published before 31 January 2020 were analyzed and discussed to better understand the epidemiology, causes, clinical diagnosis, prevention and control of this virus.

The largest proportion of published articles were related to causes (38.5%) and a majority (67.7%) were published by Chinese scholars. Research articles initially focused on causes, but over time there was an increase of the articles related to prevention and control. Studies thus far have shown that the virus’ origination is in connection to a seafood market in Wuhan, but specific animal associations have not been confirmed. Reported symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, pneumonia, headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Preventive measures such as masks, hand hygiene practices, avoidance of public contact, case detection, contact tracing, and quarantines have been discussed as ways to reduce transmission. To date, no specific antiviral treatment has proven effective; hence, infected people primarily rely on symptomatic treatment and supportive care. Conclusions",

  "chunk_text": "Abstract Objectives The novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, spreads rapidly across the world. The exponential increase in the number of cases has resulted in overcrowding of emergency departments (ED). Detection of SARS-CoV-2 is based on an RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab material. However, RT-PCR testing is time-consuming and many hospitals deal with a shortage of testing materials. Therefore, we aimed to develop an algorithm to rapidly evaluate an individual’s risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the ED. Methods In this multicenter retrospective study, routine laboratory parameters (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, absolute neutrophil and lymphocyte counts), demographic data and the chest X-ray/CT result from 967 patients entering the ED with respiratory symptoms were collected. Using these parameters, an easy-to-use point-based algorithm, called the corona-score, was developed to discriminate between patients that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and those testing negative. Computational sampling was used to optimize the corona-score.",

  "chunk_text": "Validation of the model was performed using data from 592 patients. Results The corona-score model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in the validation population. Patients testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 showed a median corona-score of 3 vs. 11 (scale 0–14) in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.001). Using cut-off values of 4 and 11 the model has a sensitivity and specificity of 96 and 95%, respectively. Conclusions The corona-score effectively predicts SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR outcome based on routine parameters. This algorithm provides the means for medical professionals to rapidly evaluate SARS-CoV-2 infection status of patients presenting at the ED with respiratory symptoms.",

In this prospective cohort study, 3526 subjects without COPD from the 2014-2015 national COPD surveillance in China were investigated for a second time during 2018-2020. Four potential pre-COPD indicators at baseline were chronic bronchitis, preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm), low peak expiratory flow (PEF), and spirometric small airway dysfunction (sSAD). To include the incident COPD subjects in the lung function decline analysis for consistent indicators, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) <80% predicted was used instead of PRISm. Lung function outcomes were the declines in post-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>, forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC.

The most common side effect associated with these agents is increased susceptibility to infection. Increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation in patients with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) has been recorded for anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents and, to a lesser extent, for the nonanti-TNFα targeted biologics. Use of both biologic agents and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors is associated with increased risk of TB disease. LTBI screening prior to initiation of a biologic agent or JAK inhibitor and treatment of positive cases significantly reduces the incidence of TB disease, though it does not eliminate it. Several recommendations and guidelines have been published, but none of them apply globally due to variable socioeconomic conditions and endemicity of TB in different countries.",

International guidelines have recently proposed fluoroquinolones for tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT) in DR-TB contacts, although the available evidence is low quality. The pooled data from small observational studies suggest that a fluoroquinolone-based TPT is safe, effective and cost-effective as a preventive treatment in DR-TB contacts. Three clinical trials are currently ongoing to generate higher quality evidence on the efficacy of levofloxacin and delamanid as a DR-TB preventive therapy. Additional evidence is also needed, regarding TPT treatment in fluoroquinolone-resistant-TB contacts, patient and health care worker perceptions on DR-TB preventive therapy for contacts, and the service delivery models to increase DR-TPT access.

CAREC data indicate\nthat between 1980 and 1990, the leading causes of mortality in all ages in the English-speaking Caribbean\nwere ischaemic heart disease, followed by cerebrovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, other heart diseases, and\nhypertension. Diabetes and hypertension contribute significantly to heart disease and stroke. Breast and\ncervical cancers are the leading causes of mortality from cancer in women, and prostate cancer is the leading\ncause of cancer deaths in men.",

Generally, severe malnutrition does not appear to be a public health\nproblem in the Caribbean. However, cases of mild and moderate malnutrition continue to be of concern in a\nfew countries. Threats to adolescent health include not only teenage pregnancy but also such problems as sexually\ntransmitted infections,  HIV/AIDS, alcohol and illegal drug abuse, physical and sexual abuse, homicide,\nsuicide, crime, and violence.

It will also include an assessment of the \nperformance of the screening test, including its ability to \npredict the presence of the condition being sought and its \nacceptability to the public. The latter will require detailed \nqualitative research to understand how the condition is \nperceived and to elicit attitudes to the proposed \ninvestigation .

This type of screening is often popular with patients because it \nconsists only of simple questions, blood pressure measurement, a \nblood test and the hopeful intent of averting a well-recognized cause \nof death. While this may encourage patients to consider lifestyle \nchanges and increase the prescription of preventative medicines \n(Robson et al., 2017), a recent Cochrane review found that health checks conferred no benefits on mortality, CVD incidence or any \nother markers of morbidity, including hospitalizations and absence \nfrom work (Krogsbøll, Jørgensen & Gøtzsche, 2019).

There appears to be a growing trend in the \nWHO European Region towards more screening for noncommunicable diseases and \nhealth checks. However, in too many cases, a clear evidence base for effectiveness is \nmissing. Policy-makers, health professionals and the public often seem unaware of the \npotential harm of screening, its cost and burden on the health system and the need for \nstrong quality assurance.",

Questions such as: How strong is the evidence base? \nWhat is the balance of benefit versus harm? Are there potential ethical \ndilemmas? Are commercial interests involved? Will this exacerbate inequities? \noften remain unanswered. Implementation requires a well-functioning health \nsystem to ensure that screening programmes are well organized and fit for \npurpose.

However, many of these \nscreening programmes are not based on available scientific evidence, and \npolicy-makers, health professionals and the public are often unaware of the \npotential harm of screening and its cost and burden. As Raffle & Gray wrote, “All \nscreening programmes do harm. Some do good as well and, of these, some do \nmore good than harm at reasonable cost.” It is therefore important to identify \nwhat the benefits and harm are and assess the balance between the two before \ndeciding to implement a screening programme. This guide aims to capture the \nchallenges policy-makers may face and lays out the important steps that should \nbe considered. It covers planning, designing, implementation, monitoring and \nevaluating screening programmes.",

  "chunk_text": "However, a reduction in mortality may take years to become \napparent, and proxy measures such as interval cancers may be used instead. Interval cancer cases are the number of cancer cases occurring between screen­\ning episodes. They will always occur because no screening programme is 100% \nsensitive, but an increase or decrease in numbers at the regional or national level \ncan be an important indicator of the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of a screen­\ning programme.  In practice, monitoring outcomes of a screening programme is not always \nstraightforward. Some of the common problems include the following.  • Poor-quality data. Incidence and mortality data rely on accurate and com­\nplete reporting of types of conditions and causes of death and registries that \ncan collect and validate the data. Reliable data is required to examine trends \nand ensure that any change after screening is introduced can be attributed to \nthe screening programme (1).",

  "chunk_text": "• Numbers too small to detect a change. When a screening programme \nstarts, the numbers may be too small to detect a real difference, and any \nchange can simply result from year-on-year variation. This especially applies \nto measuring interval cancer cases or events that do not occur very often.  •\t Detecting many cases when screening starts. Introducing a screening programme to a new geographical area often detects many cases (the preva­\nlent or first-round effect). When screening is repeated two or three years later, \nonly new cases since the first screening will be picked up which may well be \nless (second round dip). • Comparing the number of deaths before and after screening is intro­\nduced. This might be misleading because the improvement could result from \nother factors such as better diagnosis and treatment in the population rather \nthan the screening programme.  •\t Measuring survival time from diagnosis.",

So screen­ ing may lead to an increase in survival time but may not change mortality \n46 \nrates. This is called lead-time bias (Fig. 16) and is the extra time between \ndetection by screening until the condition would have been detected through \nsymptoms and clinical diagnosis. Fig. 16. Lead-time bias\nThis explains why the survival rate is not a reliable way to measure the success of \nscreening.  An increase in the number of new cases detected in a screening programme \nmay be measured rather than a reduction in mortality. Screening may increase \nthe numbers of cases detected because of overdiagnosis, but these are cases \nthat would not have caused any problem.",

The guide also outlines how to implement and operate a screening programme.  The reason for doing this is to show some of the challenges and considerable \nresources required to operate an effective programme and, most importantly, to \nshow that, unless screening programmes are done well, they are unlikely to \ndeliver the intended benefits.",

Some of these deaths could have been prevented through \nroutine check-ups and medical care. In these times of widespread financial distress, it makes the most sense to take care of your \nhealth to avoid increased, long-term medical costs. To this end, many health insurance \ncompanies cover annual visits, making these available at no additional cost to policy \nholders. Why not take advantage?
