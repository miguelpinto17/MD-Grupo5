  "abstract": "The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is home to diverse indigenous medicinal plants traditionally used for centuries. This study systematically evaluates the pharmacological and nutritional potential of key medicinal plants, including <i>Lawsonia inermis</i>, <i>Nigella sativa</i>, <i>Ziziphus spina-christi</i>, <i>Allium cepa</i>, <i>Allium sativum</i>, <i>Cymbopogon schoenanthus</i>, <i>Matricaria aurea</i>, <i>Phoenix dactylifera</i>, <i>Portulaca oleracea</i>, <i>Reichardia tingitana</i>, <i>Salvadora persica</i>, <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i>, <i>Trigonella foenum-graecum</i>, <i>Withania somnifera</i>, <i>and Ziziphus lotus.</i> Comprehensive literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify studies relevant to their nutritional and pharmacological uses. The findings highlight the therapeutic roles of these plants in managing global health challenges such as gastrointestinal diseases, and antimicrobial resistance through bioactive compounds like flavonoids, polyphenols, and antioxidants. Additionally, their contributions to nutrition, including essential vitamins and minerals, are emphasized for disease prevention and health promotion. While this research focuses on the UAE, the implications are globally relevant, as many of these plants are also found in traditional medicine across Asia, Africa, and Europe. Integrating these findings into global nutritional and healthcare systems offers potential solutions for pressing public health concerns, reduces reliance on synthetic pharmaceuticals, and promotes sustainable healthcare practices. This work is a valuable reference for researchers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers, bridging traditional knowledge and modern scientific applications globally.",

  "abstract": "Seaweed, a promising source of nutritional proteins, including protein hydrolysates, bioactive peptides, phycobiliproteins, and lectins with multi-biological activities. Seaweeds-derived proteins and peptides have attracted increasing interest for their potential applications in dietary supplements, functional foods, and pharmaceuticals industries. This work aims to comprehensively review the preparation methods and virtual screening strategies for seaweed-derived functional peptides. Additionally, it elucidates their diverse biological activities, mechanisms of action, and industrial applications. Enzymatic hydrolysis appears as the most effective method for preparing functional peptides from seaweeds. Computational virtual screening has also proven to be a valuable strategy for assessing the nature of the peptides. Seaweeds-derived proteins and peptides offer numerous health benefits, including alleviation of oxidative stress, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, anti-cancer, and anti-microbial activities. Studies indicate that proteins hydrolysates and peptides derived from seaweeds with low molecular weight and aromatic and/or hydrophobic amino acids are particularly significant in contributing to these diverse bio-activities. Furthermore, seaweeds-derived proteins and peptides hold great promise for industrial applications owing to the broad spectrum of bio-functional effects. They can be used as active ingredients in food products or pharmaceuticals for disease prevention and treatment, and as food preservatives, potentially with fewer side effects.",

  "abstract": "The products of oleaginous microbes, primarily lipids, have gained tremendous attention for their health benefits in food-based applications as supplements. However, this emerging biotechnology also offers a neuroprotective treatment/management potential for various diseases that are seldom discussed. Essential fatty acids, such as DHA, are known to make up the majority of brain phospholipid membranes and are integral to cognitive function, which forms an important defense against Alzheimer's disease. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have also been shown to reduce recurrent epilepsy seizures and have been used in brain cancer therapies. The ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 PUFAs is essential in maintaining physiological function. Furthermore, lipids have also been employed as an effective vehicle to deliver drugs for the treatment of diseases. Lipid nanoparticle technology, used in pharmaceuticals and cosmeceuticals, has recently emerged as a biocompatible, biodegradable, low-toxicity, and high-stability means for drug delivery to address the drawbacks associated with traditional medicine delivery methods. This review aims to highlight the dual benefit that lipids offer in maintaining good health for disease prevention and in the treatment of neurological diseases.",

  "abstract": "Dietary supplements (DS) and their purchase is often based on a consumer's personal choice and advertisements. The associated DS regulations, particularly in manufacturing and marketing, are far more flexible and permissive than that of the well-regulated prescription pharmaceuticals. However, the adverse health effects associated with the inadvertent use of mega-doses of DS are not well understood. The demand for DS, nutraceuticals, and herbal remedies has experienced an upswing during the past two to three decades, and global product sales have thrived. More so, the prevention of cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS) and related disorders like diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, and serum lipid abnormalities, as well as of other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), is of highest health care priority globally, since these disorders impose very high economic burdens on health care systems and society. In this review, we argue why DS could prevent cardiometabolic syndrome, by providing the potential benefits and risks associated with them, especially self-medication considering their intake by the public at large. Good manufacturing practices and quality control are absolutely necessary for the manufacture of DS products, and proper labeling is needed regarding the optimal dose schedules of various DS and bioactive ingredients. Specific examples are used to underscore the indications and dosage recommendations made for the marketing and promotion of fish oil, coenzyme Q10, and Mg-containing products for the prevention of cardiometabolic syndrome.",

  "abstract": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a common condition affecting around 10-25% of the general adult population, 15% of children, and even > 50% of individuals who have type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is a major cause of liver-related morbidity, and cardiovascular (CV) mortality is a common cause of death. In addition to being the initial step of irreversible alterations of the liver parenchyma causing cirrhosis, about 1/6 of those who develop NASH are at risk also developing CV disease (CVD). More recently the acronym MAFLD (Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease) has been preferred by many European and US specialists, providing a clearer message on the metabolic etiology of the disease. The suggestions for the management of NAFLD are like those recommended by guidelines for CVD prevention. In this context, the general approach is to prescribe physical activity and dietary changes the effect weight loss. Lifestyle change in the NAFLD patient has been supplemented in some by the use of nutraceuticals, but the evidence based for these remains uncertain. The aim of this Position Paper was to summarize the clinical evidence relating to the effect of nutraceuticals on NAFLD-related parameters. Our reading of the data is that whilst many nutraceuticals have been studied in relation to NAFLD, none have sufficient evidence to recommend their routine use; robust trials are required to appropriately address efficacy and safety.",

  "abstract": "The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence, morbidity, and mortality to inform local and international efforts toward reducing cancer burden. To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019. The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% UI, 14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI quintiles. The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to DALYs increased with SDI, ranging from 1.4% (1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7% (4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of cancer deaths and DALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage increase in the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. The results of this systematic analysis suggest that the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world.",

  "abstract": "This study explores the potential of ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) for efficiently recovering bioactive compounds, particularly rutin, from the often-overlooked leaves of Capparis spinosa. By fine-tuning important extraction parameters such as ultrasound power, temperature, and ethanol concentration, the research achieved maximum yields of total phenolic content and rutin, establishing these leaves as a sustainable and valuable source of phytochemicals for applications in functional foods, nutraceuticals, and pharmaceuticals. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis revealed a high rutin content (15.51 mg/g DW), accompanied by considerable amounts of quercetin-3-glucoside and catechin. In vitro assays revealed the extract&#039;s strong antioxidative properties, effectively safeguarding Caco-2 and Hep G2 cells against oxidative stress and significantly lowering reactive oxygen species levels. Additionally, the extract enhanced the expression of vital antioxidative enzymes and demonstrated no toxicity at the tested concentrations, confirming its safety for dietary supplement use. These findings underscore the extract’s strong safety profile and notable bioefficacy, reinforcing its suitability for incorporation into health-oriented formulations such as functional foods, dietary supplements, or nutraceutical products. Beyond demonstrating biological relevance, this research also advances the sustainable valorization of Capparis spinosa leaf biomass—an underutilized resource with high phytochemical potential—while contributing to the development of innovative, plant-based strategies for disease prevention and overall health enhancement.",

  "abstract": "Seaweed, a promising source of nutritional proteins, including protein hydrolysates, bioactive peptides, phycobiliproteins, and lectins with multi-biological activities. Seaweeds-derived proteins and peptides have attracted increasing interest for their potential applications in dietary supplements, functional foods, and pharmaceuticals industries. This work aims to comprehensively review the preparation methods and virtual screening strategies for seaweed-derived functional peptides. Additionally, it elucidates their diverse biological activities, mechanisms of action, and industrial applications. Enzymatic hydrolysis appears as the most effective method for preparing functional peptides from seaweeds. Computational virtual screening has also proven to be a valuable strategy for assessing the nature of the peptides. Seaweeds-derived proteins and peptides offer numerous health benefits, including alleviation of oxidative stress, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, anti-cancer, and anti-microbial activities. Studies indicate that proteins hydrolysates and peptides derived from seaweeds with low molecular weight and aromatic and/or hydrophobic amino acids are particularly significant in contributing to these diverse bio-activities. Furthermore, seaweeds-derived proteins and peptides hold great promise for industrial applications owing to the broad spectrum of bio-functional effects. They can be used as active ingredients in food products or pharmaceuticals for disease prevention and treatment, and as food preservatives, potentially with fewer side effects.",

  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Dietary supplements (DS) are increasingly popular worldwide, with 78% of Polish adults reporting their use, and nearly half using them regularly. The wide availability, selection, and affordability contribute to this prevalence. However, misinformation and potential health risks from incorrect usage highlight the importance of health literacy in making informed choices about DS. This study aims to assess the knowledge and practices related to dietary supplement use among Polish patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2024 on a representative sample of 1,074 Polish adults, excluding healthcare professionals, using the computer-assisted web interview method. The questionnaire assessed respondents' understanding of DS, sources of information, purchasing habits, and consultations with healthcare professionals. RESULTS Most respondents (71.79%) believed they understood what a dietary supplement is. Women and individuals with higher education were more likely to claim understanding (p=0.001, p<0.00001). The Internet was the most common information source (38.64%), followed by mass media and healthcare professionals. Women and older respondents more often consulted doctors and pharmacists (p=0.002, p=0.004). Brick-and-mortar pharmacies were the preferred purchasing location (61.64%), with men more likely to use online pharmacies (p=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS The study indicates high awareness of dietary supplements among Polish adults, with significant differences based on gender and education. Despite the Internet being a major information source, healthcare professionals remain crucial for informed decision-making. Efforts are needed to enhance public health literacy and ensure safe DS use.",

  "abstract": "Given the current global circumstances, marked by severe environmental pollution-including the contamination of food-along with daily stress and a sedentary lifestyle, many consumers choose to improve their quality of life by using, among others, minimally processed food, food supplements, and gemmo-derivatives. Recent lab and clinical studies have shown the positive impact of specific nutrients with antioxidant capacities in the treatment of several conditions generated by oxidative stress. This paper reviews antioxidant plant extracts utilized as components in various dietary supplements and gemmoderivatives, highlighting their chemical composition and biological properties in preventing diseases caused by oxidative stress. A modern approach to food science brings to the fore the concept of dietary supplements vs. functional food, nutraceuticals, and gemmo-derivatives. The definitions of these terms are not being unanimously regulated in this respect and describe each category of compound and product, also emphasizing the need to implement adequate nutrivigilance. In order to enhance the absorption and bioavailability of dietary supplements and gemmo-derivatives based on antioxidant plant extracts, some encapsulation techniques are outlined.",

  "abstract": "The urgent need to mitigate climate change requires finding sustainable and efficient alternatives to fossil fuel-based materials. Biosequestration by microalgae has been suggested as a potential method for climate change mitigation due to its environmentally friendly nature and ability to produce high-value compounds. However, the large-scale application of microalgal biorefineries faces significant challenges, particularly in the harvest and processing stages, which are often costly and energy-intensive. This study aims to benchmark value-added fractions that can be produced via microalgae-based biorefineries against their commercially available counterparts. A systematic review was conducted using the Web of Science™ database to identify current commercial sources of proteins, lipids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and pigments, this study identified key sectors and applications for each fraction, as well as potential market competitors. The results highlight substantial cost differences across production systems, with traditional agricultural sources demonstrating lower CAPEX but greater environmental challenges. Meanwhile, microalgal systems, although associated with higher CAPEX, offer advantages such as reduced land and water dependency, potentially leading to long-term economic resilience and environmental sustainability. By pinpointing research trends, key sectors and optimization opportunities, this work offers valuable insights into the profitability and competitiveness of microalgal systems, providing a benchmark for future optimization efforts. The novelty of this research lies in its comprehensive comparison of microalgae-based and traditional production systems, establishing a clear benchmark for microalgal production and suggesting focus areas for enhancement.",

  "abstract": "The burgeoning field of microbiome research has profoundly reshaped our comprehension of human health, particularly highlighting the potential of probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as therapeutic interventions. While the benefits of traditional probiotics are well-recognized, the efficacy and mechanisms remain ambiguous, and FMT's long-term effects are still being investigated. Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have identified gut microbes with significant health benefits, paving the way for next-generation probiotics (NGPs). These NGPs, engineered through synthetic biology and bioinformatics, are designed to address specific disease states with enhanced stability and viability. This review synthesizes current research on NGP stability, challenges in delivery, and their applications in preventing and treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases. We explore the physiological characteristics, safety profiles, and mechanisms of action of various NGP strains while also addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by their integration into clinical practice. The potential of NGPs to revolutionize microbiome-based therapies and improve clinical outcomes is immense, underscoring the need for further research to optimize their efficacy and ensure their safety.",

Moreover, it can be an useful tool to monitor a medical condition. A urine analysis might be a part of routine medical exam in order to check patient’s health condition but it is not recommended as a preventive screening test in the population. We believe that this article will contribute to spreading important knowledge especially in primary care.\nAim of the study:\nThe aim of the article is to collect and summarize basic information on urinalysis. We collected elemental information about routine urine examination, which includes assessment of physical properties, chemical properties and sediment composition. This knowledge is useful in the daily practice of a primary care doctor.\nMaterial and methods:\nLiterature available in the PubMed database, ScienceDirect and ClinicalKey was reviewed using the following keywords: “Urinalysis”;  “Urine sediment”, “Urinary tract infection”\nConclusions:\nThe ability of proper urine analysis is crucial in clinical practice. Performing the test is technically simple and widely available. It is important to be aware of the limitations of urine analysis. Therefore if results of urinalysis is unusual, it is necessary to require more testing to find the source of the medical issue.",

  "abstract": "This study applied Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use to examine predisposing, enabling, and need factors associated with adherence to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines for breast cancer screening (BCS). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors of BCS services utilization among 5484 women aged 50-74 from the 2019 National Health Interview Survey. Predisposing factors significantly associated with use of BCS services were: being a Black (odds-ratios [OR]:1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.14-1.95) or a Hispanic woman (OR:2.25; CI:1.62-3.12); being married/partnered (OR:1.32, CI:1.12-1.55); having more than a bachelor's degree (OR: 1.62; CI:1.14-2.30); and living in rural areas (OR:0.72; CI:0.59-0.92). Enabling factors were: poverty level [≤138% federal poverty level (FPL) (OR:0.74; CI:0.56-0.97), >138-250% FPL (OR:0.77; CI:0.61-0.97), and > 250-400% FPL (OR:0.77; CI:0.63-0.94)]; being uninsured (OR:0.29; CI:0.21-0.40); having a usual source of care at a physician office (OR:7.27; CI:4.99-10.57) or other healthcare facilities (OR:4.12; CI:2.68-6.33); and previous breast examination by a healthcare professional (OR:2.10; CI:1.68-2.64). Need factors were: having fair/poor health (OR:0.76; CI:0.59-0.97) and being underweight (OR:0.46; CI:0.30-0.71). Disparities in BCS services utilization by Black and Hispanic women have been reduced. Disparities still exist for uninsured and financially restrained women living in rural areas. Addressing disparities in BCS uptake and improving adherence to USPSTF guidelines may require revamping policies that address disparities in enabling resources, such as health insurance, income, and health care access.",

  "abstract": "<h4>Purpose</h4>To examine self-reported rates and disparities in delivery of preventive services to young adults.<h4>Methods</h4>A population-based cross-sectional analysis, of 3,670 and 3,621 young adults aged 18-26 years who responded to California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) in 2005 and CHIS 2007, respectively. The main outcome measures were self-reported receipt of flu vaccination, sexually transmitted disease (STD) screening, cholesterol screening, diet counseling, exercise counseling, and emotional health screening. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine how age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, insurance, and usual source of care influence the receipt of preventive services.<h4>Results</h4>Delivery rates ranged from 16.7% (flu vaccine) to 50.6% (cholesterol screening). Being female and having a usual source of care significantly increased receipt of services, with female participants more likely to receive STD screening (p < .001), cholesterol screening (p < .01), emotional health screening (p < .001), diet counseling (p < .01), and exercise counseling (p < .05) than male participants after controlling for age, race/ethnicity, income, insurance, and usual source of care. Young adults with a usual source of care were more likely to receive a flu vaccine (p < .05), STD screening (p < .01), cholesterol screening (p < .001), diet counseling (p < .05), and exercise counseling (p < .05) than those without a usual source of care after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, income, and insurance.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Rates of preventive services delivery are generally low. Greater efforts are needed to develop guidelines for young adults to increase the delivery of preventive care to this age-group, and to address the gender and ethnic/racial disparities in preventive services delivery.",

  "abstract": "Neighborhood environment perception (NEP) has been associated with health outcomes. However, little is known about how NEP relates to routine healthcare utilization. This study investigated the relationship between NEP and independent subfactors with healthcare utilization behavior, as measured by self-reported (1) usual source of healthcare and (2) time since last routine healthcare check-up. We used cross-sectional data from the Dallas Heart Study, which features a diverse, probability-based sample of Dallas County residents ages 18 to 65. We used logistic regression modeling to examine the association of self-reported NEP and routine healthcare utilization. NEP was assessed via a questionnaire exploring residents' neighborhood perceptions, including violence, the physical environment, and social cohesion. Routine healthcare utilization was assessed via self-reported responses regarding usual source of care and time since last routine healthcare check-up. The analytic sample (N = 1706) was 58% black, 27% white, 15% Hispanic, 42% male, and had a mean age of 51 (SD = 10.3). Analysis of NEP by tertile demonstrated that younger age, lower income, and lower education were associated with unfavorable overall NEP (p trend <0.05 for each). After adjustment for potential confounders, including neighborhood deprivation, health insurance, disease burden and psychosocial factors, we found that individuals with more unfavorable perception of their physical environment were more likely to report lack of a usual source of care (p = 0.013). Individuals with more unfavorable perception of the neighborhood physical environment or greater neighborhood violence reported longer time periods since last routine visit (p = 0.001, p = 0.034 respectively). There was no relationship between perceived social cohesion and healthcare utilization. Using a multi-ethnic cohort, we found that NEP significantly associates with report of a usual source of care and time since last routine check-up. Our findings suggest that public health professionals should prioritize improving NEP since it may act as barrier to routine preventive healthcare and ideal health outcomes.",
